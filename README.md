# CAN BMS MONITORY EXAMPLE 
This is the repository is used to store and share a little university project for the subject of “_AUTOMOTIVE CONNECTIVITY M_” at [MUNER University](https://motorvehicleuniversity.com/).

## What is it about?
We wanted to create a step by step guide for beginners of CAN bus, and we hope that with this repo you will be able to create and implement your CAN.
For more information please read our [report.]{https://github.com/mrjacopong/CAN_BMS_Monitory_Example/Documents_and_Report/Report_Design-of-a-CAN-line-for-testing.pdf}

## What is the goal?
The goal was to simulate a can bus of a battery pack, where we are able to look at: **Voltages, Current and Temperatures**.

## Does it work??
Yes! we have also a video for that, feel free to copy the code, we have only modified the main.c file and the .ioc configuration file.

## What have you used?
### Hardware
 - two **[ST nucleo F302R8](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F302R8/)** (those have the can peripheral)
 - two **[TJA1050 CAN transceiver](https://www.nxp.com/products/interfaces/can-transceivers/legacy-can/high-speed-can-transceiver:TJA1050)**
 - **[HWtronics CAN sniffer](https://www.hwtronics.com/2020/04/16/hw-mods-a-prototype-board-for-the-stlink-v3-mods/)** (not necessary, and you can use whatever can sniffer you like

### Software
 - **[STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)**
 - **[BusMaster](https://www.etas.com/en/applications/applications_busmaster.php)**

## Want to see how it is working?
Look at our report, and our [super cool video we have made.](https://youtu.be/j-Kal4BvnG0)
